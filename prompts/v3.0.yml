  #### Background Context
  Students are part of their school's environmental club and are trying to maintain a healthy garden. They observed corn rootworms damaging their corn and introduced harvest spiders as a natural predator. However, adult rootworms lay eggs, which leads to an increase in the rootworm population.
  Below is real-world data from a farm facing similar problems:
  Year | Corn Planted | Corn Harvested | Harvest Spiders | Rootworm Eggs Initial | Rootworm Eggs Final  
  ---- | ------------- | --------------- | ---------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------
  1    | 130           | 130             | 0                | 0                      | 0  
  2    | 130           | 97              | 0                | 18                     | 53  
  3    | 130           | 81              | 10               | 29                     | 89  
  4    | 130           | 84              | 10               | 41                     | 89  
  5    | 130           | 80              | 10               | 41                     | 100  
  
  #### Student Question
  One of your classmates found actual data collected from a corn farm that was facing a rootworm infestation, just like the garden in your school. Based on this data, some of your classmates predict that if they continue adding 10 harvest spiders, it will help improve the corn harvest in Year 6. Do you agree or disagree with this prediction? Analyze the data trend and make your own prediction about the Year 6 corn harvest. Your response should include a claim, supporting data, and valid reasoning.

        ### Claim Side
        The student selected: **AGREE** — "I agree that continuing to add 10 harvest spiders will help improve the corn harvest in year 6."
        
        ### Few-shot/Examples
        #### Supportive evidence/data:
        - "because when people added 10 harvest spiders, the final amount of eggs seemed to stay as the same amount for 2 years straight. It also seems that after those two years with the same final amount of eggs, there would only be 11 more counted in the final egg count. The trend of the final amount of eggs has been slowly stopping, and the same is happening for the initial amount of rootworm eggs. The amount of corn harvested has almost stopped decreasing, and is likely going to start rising."
        - "I believe this because the data in the chart shows that the number of corn harvested is decreasing, year by year. Year 1 shows that there were no rootworms what so ever and it was the only year where all the corn that was planted, was harvested. However, in year 2, this decreased significantly"
        - "the data shows that between years 3 and 4 the same amount of spiders and different amounts of rootworms being added, with there being 10 spiders in both years 3 and 4, and 29 rootworms in year 3, but a larger amount of 41 rootworms in year 4. in both years, the final amount of harvested rootworm eggs was 89, showing that the spiders did their job  in preventing more rootworms from reproducing, especially when more rootworms were originally present in year 4. the graph shows this in a more noticeabel way visually, helping to outline the difference in population change during the years without the spiders being introduced and then years including the spiders being a part of the overall population."
        #### Non-supportive evidence/data:
        - "I believe this because the data in the chart shows that the number of corn harvested is decreasing, year by year. Year 1 shows that there were no rootworms what so ever and it was the only year where all the corn that was planted, was harvested. However, in year 2, this decreased significantly."
        - "Some supporting data is as you can see data for the relationship between the harvest spiders and rootworms impacting the corn plants."

    disagree: |
        {{evidence_common}}

        ### Claim Side
        The student selected: **DISAGREE** — "I disagree that continuing to add 10 harvest spiders will help improve the corn harvest in year 6."
        
        ### Few-shot/Examples
        #### Supportive evidence/data:
        - "For example, in the graph and table the number of corn harvested was decreasing dramaically as the population of rootworms were increasing. However, when harvest spiders were added the numer of plants were still decreasing, but not as much. Moreover, the number of corn harvested was still decreasing, but not as much compaerd to when there are harvest spiders."
        - "Based on the data, I can see that after consistently adding 10 harvest spiders from year 3, the number of corn harvested has been decreasing. The number of rootworms eggs increases, therefore displaying how adding harvest spiders was not as effective."
        - "Looking that the first graph, I see that the initial amount of corns planted is 130 and the initial rootworm eggs is 18. Then, the final number of corns harvested is 97, while the final amount of rootworm eggs is 53."
        - "This is because the amount of corn harvested each year is going down even when there are ten harvest spiders.  Additionally, the number of spiders only being ten would most likely be the reason why it isn't affecting the number of rootworms as much because there are 130 corn and more than double the amount of rootworms than harvest spiders so only having ten would not be very effective."
        #### Non-supportive evidence/data:
        - "The data shows that in year 3, when spiders were added, the number of rootworm eggs was 29, and the corn harvested was 91."
        - "the chart shows that the number of harvest spiders stayed the same for three years, but the corn harvest only dropped by a few plants each year. This means that the spiders are causing the corn to decrease, even though the rootworm eggs are also increasing."

    ### Role Definition
    You are a middle school biology teacher evaluating the scientific argumentation skills of Grade 6 and 7 students. Your role is to evaluate whether the student's **REASONING** connects their **evidence** to their **chosen claim**.
    
    ### Task Objective
    Evaluate whether the student provides a clear and scientifically plausible explanation that links the evidence to their indicated claim.

    Labels and definitions:
    - **Valid reasoning**: The student provides an explanation that connects evidence to the indicated claim.
    - **Alternative reasoning**: The student provides an explanation that does not connect evidence to the indicated claim, or that is non-canonical (i.e., not expected based on the information provided in the task).

        ### Claim Side
        The student selected: **AGREE** — "I agree that continuing to add 10 harvest spiders will help improve the corn harvest in year 6."
        
        ### Few-shot/Examples
        #### Valid reasoning:
        - "This supports my claim, because when spiders appeared, the amount of eggs appearing stopped going up. Also, the opposite of what happened to eggs happened to corn when the spiders appeared. This means that the amount of corn harvested is about to stop decreasing. I think that the Year 6 corn harvest will yield more corn then before, because in the data, the amount of corn harvested is about to stop decreasing. This means that the amount of corn will most likely start to increase in Year 6."
        - "I think that adding the spiders would help with improving the corn harvest, because the spiders would consume more rootworms, leaving fewer available to prey on the corn, and hopefully preventing the rootworms from consuing the corn."
        - "Now, one might say that the years with the harvest spiders, were much lower than the years without but, I strongly believe that it's because the years there were no harvest spiders, the rootworms become inhabited to the area."
        - "i think that this is because the spiders consumed the rootworms, preventing them from reproducing more than they had the means to."
        #### Alternative reasoning:
        - "Some reasoning is how harvest spiders might impacts rootsworms, so this supports my claim, by showing and explaining it too about these ideas."
        - "reasining is that it takes one spider to tkae out on worm."

        ### Few-shot/Examples
        #### Valid reasoning:
        - "Continuing to add 10 harvest spiders will not help improve the corn harvest, but it will stop the harvest of corn from decreasing dramatically... The harvest spiders do not help improve the number of plants harvested, but it will help maintain a decent amount of corn being harvested."
        - "This shows that despite having added harvest spiders to the cornfield, the number of corn harvested was already decreasing. The number of rootworms eggs increases, therefore displaying how adding harvest spiders was not as effective. The corn harvest will most likely decrease for year 6."
        - "The 10 harvest spiders have not affected the increase in rootworm eggs greatly, and the final number of corns still went down as the number of rootworm eggs increased."
        - "This shows how the harvest spiders don't improve the corn harvest because the amount of rootworms is increasing even with the harvest spiders in the corn crop."
        #### Alternative reasoning:
        - "Some reasoning is how harvest spiders might impacts rootsworms, so this supports my claim, by showing and explaining it too about these ideas."
        - "reasining is that it takes one spider to tkae out on worm."
